# Job-Recommendation-Portal-2K21-Project


A job recommendation portal built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) involves various components working together to provide a seamless experience for users seeking jobs and employers posting job listings. Here’s a breakdown of key elements involved:

### 1. **Frontend (React)**
   - **User Interface**: Built using React, the frontend is responsible for rendering the pages where users can:
     - View job recommendations
     - Filter jobs based on criteria like location, job type, salary, etc.
     - Apply for jobs or save them for later
     - Create and manage profiles
   - **Authentication**: React communicates with the backend to handle user login, registration, and profile management using tokens for authentication.

### 2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
   - **API Development**: Using Express, the backend provides APIs that allow the frontend to:
     - Fetch job listings
     - Handle applications
     - Manage user data and profiles
     - Perform search and filtering based on keywords, location, and other job-related parameters
   - **Authentication Middleware**: Middleware functions like `isAuthenticated` can be used to secure routes, ensuring only logged-in users can access certain endpoints.

### 3. **Database (MongoDB)**
   - **Job Listings**: Jobs are stored in MongoDB using a Mongoose model (e.g., `Job`). Each job entry may include fields like job title, description, company, salary, location, and required skills.
   - **User Profiles**: MongoDB stores user profiles, including resumes, experience, skills, and preferences, which help in customizing job recommendations.
   - **Application Tracking**: Tracks which users applied to which jobs and the status of those applications (e.g., pending, accepted, rejected).

### 4. **Recommendation Algorithm**
   - **User Preferences**: The system can recommend jobs based on user preferences, resume data, or search history.
   - **Matching Criteria**: Matching jobs with users may involve factors like:
     - Keywords matching job descriptions with user profiles
     - Location proximity
     - Experience level and skills alignment

### 5. **Role-based Access Control**
   - Different users (job seekers, employers, admins) have different levels of access. A flag-based approach (0, 1, 2) can be used to handle permissions.
     - **Job Seekers** (0): Can browse and apply for jobs.
     - **Employers** (1): Can post jobs, manage listings, and view applications.
     - **Admins** (2): Can manage both users and jobs, and moderate content.

### 6. **Key Features**
   - **Search and Filters**: Enables users to filter job listings by criteria like job type (full-time, part-time), location, industry, and salary.
   - **Resume Parsing**: Optionally, the system can parse uploaded resumes to auto-fill job applications and suggest relevant positions.
   - **Notifications**: Users can receive notifications about new job postings or application status updates.

This structure provides a flexible, scalable system for job recommendation, with a focus on user experience, security, and efficient data management.
